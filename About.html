            <p>
                Front-End Developer that invests extra time in being mentored and has a track record of working well with experienced devs. 
                Taking on extra responsibilities when necessary and working closely with team members to ensure workloads are efficiently directed to bottlenecks. 
                I attended a coding bootcamp with a love for both personal development and software development to learn new languages and hone my already-existing skills. 
                I'm prepared to use my enthusiasm for coding to help a skilled technical team create superior solutions.
